COLLECTION OF FRONTIERS

Numbers represent the largest time-step at each spatial point.
Two consecutive time-steps should be stored in the frontier,
other than in the overlapping region represented by (8),
where only the 5th time-step is stored.  The numbers are cyclic,
i.e., 0 represents 10 when it is adjacent to a 9.

FRONTIERS NEEDED FOR A PYRAMID

Each frontier is shaped like a dagger blade in 3D.  The "root" of
the blade has the largest time-step, 10 (represented by 0) in this case.
The "edges" of the dagger has the smallest time-step, 5 in this case.
Other than the edgges which has only the 5th time-step, all spatial point has
two consecutive time-steps, the one indicated and the one before it.
